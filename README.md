## Introduction:

Did you know that it takes a lot of effort and time to complete the process of enrolling a single student in the different courses offered by the CEC-Y?
We are a team of trained developers with knowledge in several programming languages as well as database management with experience in the development of web pages and applications.
The CEC-Y department is usually frustrated by the effort and difficulty they have in administering, registering, validating and verifying the information received by the academic community in order to participate in any of their promoted courses.
Modularly we will carry out the analysis, improvements and/or development, of the current procedures, automating them in order to eliminate cumbersome manual processes that demand time, are slow and not very effective.
With this we will make the CEC-Y more efficient in its procedure as far as the registration process is concerned, thus optimizing both staff and computer resources.
We consider that we have the knowledge that is needed to be able to develop this module in an effective and attractive way being the most suitable to be able to give solution to this problem.

## Details:

1. Executive summary.
   The registration module of the CEC-Y, which is being re-engineered, is a proprietary system that is in the process of migration. It will have the capacity to directly register the information of the applicants in the institutional database (IGNUG). In this way, all the data will be centralized, improving the registration of the applicants since they are all integrated in one single platform.

2. Objectives.
