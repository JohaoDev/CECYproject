              The story begins as Don Vito Corleone, the head of a New York
              Mafia family, overseeshis daughter's wedding. His beloved son
              ichael has just come home from the war, but does not intend to
              become part of his father's business. T hrough Michael's life the
              nature of the family business becomes clear. The business of the
              family is just like the head of the family, kind and benevolent to
              those who give respect, but given to ruthless violence whenever
              anything stands against the good of the family.

              Francis Ford Coppola's legendary continuation and sequel to his
              landmark 1972 film, The_Godfather parallels the young Vito
              Corleone's rise with his son Michael's spiritual fall, deepening
              The_Godfather's depiction of the dark side of the American dream.
              In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for
              America after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito struggles to
              make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and growing
              brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci after
              he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci
              gone, Vito's communal stature grows.

            <p-accordionTab header="Observaciones">
              After a break of more than 15 years, director Francis Ford Coppola
              and writer Mario Puzo returned to the well for this third and
              final story of the fictional Corleone crime family. Two decades
              have passed, and crime kingpin Michael Corleone, now divorced from
              his wife Kay has nearly succeeded in keeping his promise that his
              family would one day be completely legitimate.
